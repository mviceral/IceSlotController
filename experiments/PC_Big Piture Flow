User start from linux box


Load the configurations from local file
    connect to each BBB
        copy the configurations to the BBBs.
        linux box tells BBB 
            - that configuration files are available for processing
            - to start process BBB using uploaded configuration 
    If connection to a BBB fails
        - system halts.    
        
        
Run Cycle    
    stay connected to BBB to get any events
        Type of event from BBB
            - Error
            - state
                - loading
                - running
                - stopping
                - time before completion?
    If connection to a BBB fails
        - system halts.


Complete 
    BBBs send events to linux box 


Things to consider:
    How will the linux box start the processes in BBB? 
        Shell cmd? "run &"
        
    Will the linux box ping the BBB if the process is complete?
    If the user would like to see the data recorded from the dbase, how are the data going to be moved from BBB to linux box?
