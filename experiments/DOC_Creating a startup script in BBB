The purpose of this code is to setup the BBB to start up a script to change the IP address to something that is 
specified.

Below is the webpage content:
Creating my own systemd service files on Fedora 16(x86_64)

systemd is a replacement for the System V init daemon for Linux. It is intended to provide a better framework for expressing services’ dependencies, allow more work to be done in parallel at system startup, and to reduce shell overhead. It has been used starting with Fedora 15.

On my environment, the system is Fedora 16(X86_64). I want to send my radius log to another web server per 5 second so as to monitor it conveniently.

Create the script file
# vi /usr/local/bin/radinfo

#!/bin/bash
while true
do
  ext=$(date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S)
  tail -200 /var/log/radius/radius.log > /dev/shm/radinfo
  scp /dev/shm/radinfo kezhong@192.168.1.20:/var/www/html/radinfo/r$ext
  ssh kezhong@192.168.1.20 “find /var/www/html/radinfo/ -cmin +60 -exec rm {} \;”                 
  sleep 5
done

Give it execute permission
# chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/radinfo

Create the service file
# vi /lib/systemd/system/radinfo.service

[Unit]
Description=Sending radius log to management server
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/radinfo

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Make symbolic link
# cd /etc/systemd/system/
# ln -s /lib/systemd/system/radinfo.service radinfo.service

Make systemd take notice of it
# systemctl daemon-reload

Activate a service immediately
# systemctl start radinfo.service

Enable a service to be started on bootup
# systemctl enable radinfo.service
